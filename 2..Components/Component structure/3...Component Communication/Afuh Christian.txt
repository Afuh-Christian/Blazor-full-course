-I am from Cameroon , specifically in Bamenda at the moment 
-I am a self taught software developer 
-During  my Journey , I have learnt Programing Languages like 
	-Javascript
	-Java 
	-Python
	-C 
	-C# 
	-C++
	-Kotlin 

-Learning all these Languages made me realize they all use thesame 
 concepts 

-I went further to now learn Django , an I understood how all the data
 was being handled 

-But I realized that Html,css , and Js weren't enough for the front
 end because routing appeared to be slow 

-I now learnt React and realized it had alot of capabilities 

-I know I don't know much about this field because I haven't spent that much time 
 one it . But the one thing I can assure you is that , I am a very fast learner 
 and also I alway try to get better and better daily 

-I've been on this coding journey for two years now with many different programming 
 languages 

-But now I now want to focus on one which is Javascript  and use 
 frameworks just for it so I may one day be an expert
