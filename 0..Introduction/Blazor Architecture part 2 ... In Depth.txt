Blazor ...... In depth 

##################------CLIENT SIDE --------#############################################


We need to be able to run the code on the browser 

-Web ASEMBLY  ...
	-Is a language that can run directly in the browser(because  chrome ,internet explorer etc are grade on this web asymbly standared)
		-as long as your code is writen in web asembly language , there's browser support 
		  and it's runs natively and it runs realy fast ... perfomance is amazing 

	-Is  a compiler target 
		source(language) ----> COMPILER(converts)------> target(language) 
		eg C# ----to ---> Intermediate language(runs within .net runtime)

	-C# runs is the browser as web asembly (this is not entirely true in terms of how blazor runs on the browser)
	-Blazor does not turn the c# code into web asymbly

Blazor does mono web asembly 

MONO WEB ASEMBLY 
-Is a runtime 
-It itself is a web asembly 
-It runs on the browser 


BROWSER 
	-DOM 
	-layers
		-mono-webasembly
		-.Net stard 
			-blazor framework
 				Blazor app (runs here) 

-when the blazor server runs ... 
-when the user sends an http request through the browser 
-the server first pushes the mono web asembly to the browser 

-Now the blazor app (all dependencies will be downloaded to the server ) 



How does blazor uses html 
-Blazor uses a component based archietecture 
	-we create components in the blazor app and we call it the component tree
	-this component is being tracked by the blazor app 
		-In the app 
			-prev tree 
			-current tree
		
	-when ever the user makes some changes , it generates the current tree and then compares with the prev tree 
	 and then create a component tree div and will be sent to the dom and used to update the dom 


.NET standard = c# dll 
blazor framework = c# dll 
blazor app = c# dll 
 



###################---------SERVER SIDE ------#############################33

Works similarly as in part 1 
-everything happens on the server side 



BROWSER 
	-DOM 
	-BLAZOR SERVER .JS 

	

SERVER 
	-.NET FRAMEWORK 
		-BLAZOR FRAMEWORK 
			-BLAZOR APP
				-prev tree
				-current tree


Browser --------(signalR)--------- server
