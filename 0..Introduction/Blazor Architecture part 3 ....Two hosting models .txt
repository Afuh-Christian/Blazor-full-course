###########--------SERVER SIDE -------------###############3

-pros 
	-very fast inital load because everything is on the server ... 
	-we can directly call 
		-service layers 
		-repository layers 
	 without calling an api
	-no worry for 
		-sercurity 
		-json convertion 


-cons 
	-eg a variable that stores thousands of rows of data , that data has to be rendered to the render tree
	 and we have two render trees (current and prev)  , and because you're in the variable , you already have thousand of rows ,
	 and those rows will have to be reflected within those two render trees , so we will end up keeping large amount of data on the server side 
	 
	-burden on the signalR


Good for creating small apps .... not using large amount of data 

-use pagging 
-save data often
